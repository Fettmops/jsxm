# xm.js

FastTracker 2 .XM player, written for fun.

[Demo](http://www.a1k0n.net/code/jsxm/)

By default it plays "my dirty old kamel" by Alexander Bul√©r aka
[Zalza](http://zalza.bandcamp.com/). I love this tune, and wrote this code just
to play it. It can also load some other tunes hosted on my website with a file
picker, and it should play just about any .XM file now if checked out and run
locally.

It is fairly feature-complete, but is missing a bunch of effects.
