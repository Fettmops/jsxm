# xm.js

FastTracker 2 .XM player, written for fun.

[Demo](http://www.a1k0n.net/code/jsxm/) [warning: plays sound immediately on
load]

It only plays one .XM: "my dirty old kamel" by Alexander Bul√©r aka
[Zalza](http://zalza.bandcamp.com/). I love this tune, and wrote this code just
to play it.

It is fairly feature-complete, but is missing a bunch of effects.
